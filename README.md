# Undiagnosed celiac

The HLA allele DQB102 is present in >90% of celiac patients.
We can correlate national HLA allele frequencies with reported celiac rates.
Outliers in this relationship may indicate undiagnosed cases of celiac disease.
In addition, we can use HLA frequencies to estimate rates of celiac disease in countries where
data is missing. Finally maybe we can do something cool filling in HLA frequency data
using priors.

- [] Get estimates of celiac disease rates
- [] Get estimates of DQB1*02 frequency
- [] Plot both as choropleths
- [] Plot correlation
- [] Identify outliers in celiac disease rates
- [] Fill in missing celiac disease rates from HLA data
