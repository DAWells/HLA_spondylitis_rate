# Undiagnosed ankylosing spondyloarthritis

The HLA-B27 is present in ~90% of ankylosing spondyloarthritis patients.
We can correlate national HLA allele frequencies with reported ankylosing
spondyloarthritis rates. Outliers in this relationship may indicate
undiagnosed cases. In addition, we can use HLA frequencies to estimate
rates of celiac disease in countries where data is missing. Finally
maybe we can do something cool filling in HLA frequency data using priors.

- [x] Get estimates of ankylosing spondyloarthritis rates
- [x] Get estimates of HLA-B27 frequency
- [x] Plot both as choropleths
- [x] Plot correlation
- [x] Identify outliers in disease rates
- [x] Fill in missing disease rates from HLA data
